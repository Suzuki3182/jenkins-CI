## About

The goal of this repository is to provide a straightforward way to set up a Jenkins CI server with **authentication enabled**. Jenkins is a powerful open-source automation server that supports building, deploying, and automating projects. By enabling authentication, this setup ensures that only authorized users can access and manage the Jenkins server.

---

## Features

- **Authentication Enabled**: Secure access to the Jenkins server.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple configuration to get started quickly.
- **Customizable**: Extendable for additional plugins and configurations.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Jenkins CI server, ensure you have the following:

- **Docker**: Install Docker to run Jenkins in a containerized environment.
  - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Basic Knowledge of Jenkins**: Familiarity with Jenkins concepts and workflows.
- **Internet Connection**: To pull the required Docker images and plugins.

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suzuki3182/jenkins-CI.git
cd jenkins-CI
```

### Step 2: Run Jenkins Using Docker

Use the following command to start Jenkins in a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --name jenkins-server jenkins/jenkins:lts
```

- `-p 8080:8080`: Maps port 8080 of the container to your host machine.
- `-p 50000:50000`: Maps port 50000 for agent communication.
- `--name jenkins-server`: Assigns a name to the container.

### Step 3: Access Jenkins

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
2. Retrieve the initial admin password by running:
   ```bash
   docker exec jenkins-server cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.

## Usage

Once Jenkins is up and running, you can:

- Create and configure jobs for your CI/CD pipelines.
- Install additional plugins to extend functionality.
- Manage user authentication and permissions.

For detailed documentation on Jenkins usage, refer to the [official Jenkins documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/).
